<p align='center' style="text-align:center;font-size:1em;">
The first part focuses on implementing recursive algorithms and binary tree operations in Java. It offers solutions to two distinct problems involving binary trees and recursion.
The tasks involve path traversal and level-based analysis of binary tree structures, enhancing understanding and proficiency in recursive algorithms and tree data structures
This second part aims to develop a reentrant lock mechanism in Java, providing a robust synchronization solution for concurrent programming.
The implemented lock will allow threads to acquire and release locks safely while supporting reentrant behavior, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of multi-threaded applications.
